# 👋 Hey there, I'm Najm Aldeen!

🎓 Third-year IT student | 💻 Front-End Enthusiast | 🚀 Aspiring Software Engineer

I break things (just enough to fix them better), build UIs that don’t scream, and work with APIs like we’ve been lifelong friends. I'm passionate about turning ideas into interactive experiences — fast, clean, and responsive.

## 📂 Featured Repositories

### 🎮 [Game List](https://github.com/NajmAlzorqah/game-list)
A lightning-fast game discovery app powered by the [RAWG API](https://rawg.io/apidocs).  
Built with React 19, Vite, Chakra UI, Zustand, and React Query. Features infinite scrolling, theme switching, API caching, and sleek UI animations.  
Because browsing 350,000+ games should be *fun* and *blazing fast*.

### 🦷 [Belleville Dental](https://github.com/NajmAlzorqah/belleville-dental-react-eproject)
A full-featured dental clinic website — for humans, not tooth fairies.  
Created as part of my CPISM course using React JS. Patients can book appointments, browse services, and contact the clinic with ease.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- Sharpening my Spring Boot & backend development
- Mastering clean code & component-based architecture
- Diving deeper into advanced TypeScript & design systems

## 🧠 Fun Facts
- 🧩 I love solving coding puzzles and optimizing things just for the thrill of it.
- 📱 I like building things that look good on both 32" monitors and tiny phone screens.
- 🕹️ I built a gaming app — and yes, I tested it thoroughly... for research, of course.
